    For Federal agencies and their digital service teams who need evidence-based
    accessibility research and design patterns for web components, the Federal
    Accessibility Research Initiative (FARI) is a government user research
    program that provides comprehensive usability data for 100+ web components
    tested with diverse disability communities. Unlike relying on automated
    accessibility scanners and generic WCAG compliance checklists, our program
    offers real-world user research with people across cognitive, motor,
    sensory, and multiple disability types using actual assistive technologies.
methodology:

soo_inputs:
  problem_context: >-
    Federal agencies struggle to create truly accessible digital services
    because current accessibility practices focus on technical compliance rather
    than user experience. Automated scanning tools catch only 20-30% of
    accessibility barriers, and generic WCAG guidelines don't provide specific
    guidance for complex interactive components. Government teams lack access to
    people with disabilities for testing, and when research is conducted, it
    often focuses on single disability types rather than the full spectrum of
    accessibility needs. This results in websites that technically comply with
    Section 508 but still present significant usability barriers for citizens
    with disabilities.
  objectives: |-
    - People with diverse disabilities can successfully complete tasks using 100+ common government web components within target timeframes
    - Federal development teams can access detailed usability findings and design recommendations for each tested component
    - Government agencies can implement evidence-based accessibility design patterns that improve user success rates by 75%
    - Citizens with disabilities report improved satisfaction with federal digital services from baseline 2.8/5 to 4.2/5
    - Federal accessibility specialists can validate that recommended design patterns work across multiple assistive technology combinations
    - Research participants represent the full spectrum of disability types including cognitive, motor, sensory, and multiple disabilities
    - Study results demonstrate measurable improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction for citizens with disabilities
  constraints: |-
    - Must comply with federal human subjects research requirements and IRB approval processes
    - Must recruit participants across cognitive disabilities (learning, attention, memory), motor disabilities (limited mobility, tremor, paralysis), sensory disabilities (blindness, low vision, deafness, hard of hearing), and multiple disabilities
    - Must test components with major assistive technologies including screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver), voice control software, switch navigation, and magnification tools
    - Must protect participant privacy and accommodate communication preferences and accessibility needs during research sessions
    - Research timeline must account for extended recruitment periods needed to reach diverse disability communities
    - Budget not to exceed $2.8M for participant recruitment, compensation, research facilitation, and analysis over 18 months
    - Must include both remote and in-person research options to accommodate participant needs and geographic distribution
    - Results must be published in accessible formats and made available to all federal agencies within 6 months of study completion

    # Statement of Objectives (SOO)
    ## Federal Accessibility Research Initiative (FARI)
    ### User Research on Web Component Accessibility

    ### Problem Statement

    Federal agencies struggle to create truly accessible digital services because current accessibility practices focus on technical compliance rather than user experience. Automated scanning tools catch only 20-30% of accessibility barriers, and generic WCAG guidelines don't provide specific guidance for complex interactive components. Government teams lack access to people with disabilities for testing, and when research is conducted, it often focuses on single disability types rather than the full spectrum of accessibility needs. This results in websites that technically comply with Section 508 but still present significant usability barriers for citizens with disabilities.

    ### Objectives

    The General Services Administration requires comprehensive user research that achieves the following outcomes for federal digital accessibility:

    **User Experience Outcomes:**
    - People with diverse disabilities can successfully complete tasks using 100+ common government web components within target timeframes
    - Citizens with disabilities report improved satisfaction with federal digital services from baseline 2.8/5 to 4.2/5
    - Research participants represent the full spectrum of disability types including cognitive, motor, sensory, and multiple disabilities

    **Government Team Outcomes:**
    - Federal development teams can access detailed usability findings and design recommendations for each tested component
    - Government agencies can implement evidence-based accessibility design patterns that improve user success rates by 75%
    - Federal accessibility specialists can validate that recommended design patterns work across multiple assistive technology combinations

    **Program Impact Outcomes:**
    - Study results demonstrate measurable improvements in task completion rates and user satisfaction for citizens with disabilities
    - Research findings enable government-wide adoption of evidence-based accessibility practices
    - Federal agencies achieve improved Section 508 compliance through user-centered design rather than checklist compliance

    ### Constraints

    **Research Ethics and Compliance:**
    - Must comply with federal human subjects research requirements and IRB approval processes
    - Must protect participant privacy and accommodate communication preferences and accessibility needs during research sessions

    **Participant Representation Requirements:**
    - Must recruit participants across cognitive disabilities (learning, attention, memory), motor disabilities (limited mobility, tremor, paralysis), sensory disabilities (blindness, low vision, deafness, hard of hearing), and multiple disabilities
    - Must include both remote and in-person research options to accommodate participant needs and geographic distribution
    - Research timeline must account for extended recruitment periods needed to reach diverse disability communities

    **Technical and Accessibility Requirements:**
    - Must test components with major assistive technologies including screen readers (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver), voice control software, switch navigation, and magnification tools
    - Results must be published in accessible formats and made available to all federal agencies within 6 months of study completion

    **Resource and Timeline Constraints:**
    - Budget not to exceed $2.8M for participant recruitment, compensation, research facilitation, and analysis over 18 months

    ### Success Criteria

    Success will be measured by improved usability outcomes for people with disabilities interacting with government web components, the quality and actionability of research findings for federal teams, and the adoption of evidence-based accessibility practices across government agencies. Vendors should propose research approaches that prioritize participant accessibility needs while generating actionable insights for government digital service improvement.
