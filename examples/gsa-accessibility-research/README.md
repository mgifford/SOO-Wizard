# GSA Federal Accessibility Research Initiative (FARI) - SOO Example

## Overview
This example demonstrates how to use the SOO Wizard for a General Services Administration procurement to conduct comprehensive user research on web component accessibility with people with disabilities.

## Scenario
**Client:** General Services Administration (GSA)  
**Project:** Federal Accessibility Research Initiative (FARI)  
**Goal:** Research how people with disabilities interact with 100+ common government web components to improve federal digital accessibility

## Key Features of This Example

### 1. **Disability-Inclusive Research Approach**
- Covers cognitive, motor, sensory, and multiple disabilities
- Tests with major assistive technologies (screen readers, voice control, switch navigation, magnification)
- Accommodates diverse communication needs and accessibility requirements

### 2. **Comprehensive Component Testing**
- 100+ web components tested for real-world usability
- Focus on task completion rates and user satisfaction outcomes
- Evidence-based design recommendations for government teams

### 3. **Federal Compliance Integration**
- IRB approval and human subjects research requirements
- Section 508 compliance improvement goals
- Government-wide dissemination and adoption planning

## Research Scope Highlights

### Participant Diversity Requirements
```yaml
Constraint: "Must recruit participants across cognitive disabilities (learning, attention, memory), 
motor disabilities (limited mobility, tremor, paralysis), sensory disabilities (blindness, 
low vision, deafness, hard of hearing), and multiple disabilities"
```

### Assistive Technology Coverage
- **Screen Readers:** JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver
- **Voice Control:** Dragon NaturallySpeaking, Voice Control (iOS/macOS)
- **Switch Navigation:** Various switch devices and scanning interfaces
- **Magnification:** ZoomText, built-in OS magnifiers

### Success Metrics
- Improve user success rates by 75%
- Increase satisfaction from 2.8/5 to 4.2/5
- Reduce accessibility complaints by 60%
- Generate $50M annual savings in remediation costs

## Timeline and Budget Structure

**Duration:** 18 months  
**Budget:** $2.8M  
**Key Phases:**
1. **Months 1-3:** IRB approval, participant recruitment, methodology finalization
2. **Months 4-12:** Component testing across disability types and assistive technologies
3. **Months 13-15:** Analysis, pattern identification, recommendation development
4. **Months 16-18:** Report creation, training development, government-wide dissemination

## How This Differs from Traditional Research RFPs

### ✅ Outcome-Focused Approach
```yaml
# Instead of prescribing methods:
Objective: "People with diverse disabilities can successfully complete tasks using 100+ common government web components"

# Rather than technical deliverables:
Objective: "Federal development teams can access detailed usability findings and design recommendations"
```

### ✅ User-Centered Success Criteria
- Focus on participant experience and government team outcomes
- Measurable improvements in satisfaction and task completion
- Evidence-based design patterns that work across assistive technologies

### ✅ Flexible Implementation
- Vendors can propose their own research methodologies
- Accommodation for diverse participant needs and preferences
- Multiple testing approaches (remote, in-person, hybrid)

## Vendor Innovation Opportunities

With this SOO, vendors might propose:

**Approach A:** Distributed testing network with community-based research partnerships  
**Approach B:** Intensive lab-based studies with detailed behavioral analysis  
**Approach C:** Longitudinal research tracking component improvements over time  
**Approach D:** Hybrid methodology combining automated analysis with human insight

## Expected Research Outcomes

### For Federal Agencies
- **Design Patterns:** Evidence-based accessibility patterns for 100+ components
- **Implementation Guidance:** Step-by-step instructions for developers
- **Testing Protocols:** Methods for ongoing accessibility validation
- **Training Resources:** Educational materials for government teams

### For Citizens with Disabilities
- **Improved Usability:** Higher task completion rates on government websites
- **Better Experience:** Increased satisfaction with federal digital services
- **Reduced Barriers:** Fewer accessibility obstacles in government interactions
- **Broader Access:** More government services accessible across disability types

## Procurement Innovation Benefits

This example shows how outcome-based SOOs enable:

- **Research Innovation:** Vendors can propose creative methodologies
- **Participant-Centered Design:** Focus on accessibility needs rather than compliance
- **Scalable Impact:** Research insights benefit entire federal government
- **Evidence-Based Policy:** Data-driven improvements to accessibility practices

## Adapting This Example

For other accessibility research:

1. **Change the scope:** Modify component types or testing focus areas
2. **Adjust populations:** Target specific disability communities or age groups
3. **Update technology:** Include emerging assistive technologies or platforms
4. **Modify constraints:** Adapt compliance requirements for different agencies

For non-accessibility research:
1. **Change user groups:** Replace disability focus with other underserved populations
2. **Adjust research goals:** Focus on different usability or experience outcomes
3. **Update compliance:** Modify for different federal research requirements

## Research Ethics Considerations

This example includes important considerations for accessibility research:

- **Informed Consent:** Accessible consent processes for all participants
- **Privacy Protection:** Safeguarding participant data and personal information
- **Accommodation:** Research methods that work for diverse accessibility needs
- **Compensation:** Appropriate payment for participant time and expertise
- **Community Partnership:** Building relationships with disability organizations

## Next Steps

1. Import this example into the SOO Wizard
2. Customize for your specific research needs and agency requirements
3. Review with accessibility specialists and disability community representatives
4. Generate final SOO and vendor instruction pack
5. Coordinate with procurement and research compliance teams
6. Consider pilot testing with smaller component sets before full implementation
