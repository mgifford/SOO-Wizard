  moore_statement: >
    For Maryland residents and businesses using State digital services, the Maryland Digital Experience
    Modernization Capability is an outcome-based digital service delivery approach that enables users
    to complete priority tasks online clearly, accessibly, and reliably; unlike fragmented agency-by-agency
    delivery, it standardizes patterns and quality measures while keeping artifacts and code in the
    government domain.

  context: "new_dev" # Contract is a vehicle for multiple work orders spanning discovery through build/operate

soo_inputs:
  problem_context: >
    Maryland DoIT will have a scalable approach for delivering and improving digital services across agencies.
    Current delivery is constrained by inconsistent design patterns, uneven accessibility and usability,
    and variable software quality and security practices. The State will have a repeatable approach
    to research-driven product development (including user research and usability testing), plain-language
    content, and measurable operational reliability. In addition, the State will receive evidence-based
    assessments of CMS alternatives to support future platform decisions.
  objectives:
    - >
      Residents and businesses can complete priority online tasks with fewer errors and less time,
      on mobile and desktop, using clear plain-language content and consistent interaction patterns.
    - >
      People with disabilities can access and use State digital services with verified conformance to
      WCAG 2.1 AA and State non-visual access requirements, with documented remediation timelines.
    - >
      State product teams can continuously prioritize and deliver improvements using validated user research
      and transparent priority management shaped with the Product Owner/State staff.
    - >
      The State can deploy improvements frequently without downtime, with build and deployment automation
      and observable performance (monitoring, error tracking, analytics).
    - >
      The State can maintain a measurable software quality baseline (automated tests, code style checks,
      vulnerability reduction) and retain State ownership over source code and key artifacts.
    - >
      DoIT receives actionable assessments of feasible CMS alternatives that support statewide standards,
      accessibility, and long-term operational support.

    # Statement of Objectives (SOO)
    ## Program: Agile Digital Experience Product Transformation (ADEPT)

    ### 1. Problem Statement
    Maryland DoIT must improve how the State delivers and evolves digital services across agencies.
    The State needs consistent user experiences (aligned to statewide patterns), accessible services,
    clearer content, and stronger quality and security practices that can scale across many work orders.
    The State also requires measurable delivery in short iterations and the ability to assess platform
    options (including CMS alternatives) without creating technology lock-in.

    ### 2. Objectives (Outcome-Focused)
    1. **Task completion and clarity**
       - Residents and businesses can complete priority online tasks on mobile and desktop with reduced errors,
         fewer dead ends, and content that is demonstrably understandable (plain language validated with users).

    2. **Accessibility as a shipped property**
       - Delivered services demonstrate conformance to WCAG 2.1 AA and Maryland non-visual access requirements.
       - Prior to production/go-live, DoIT receives an accessibility audit report (automated + manual),
         a remediation timeline for issues, and validation evidence for fixes.

    3. **Consistent statewide experience**
       - State digital products use reusable patterns and guidance (leveraging USWDS) so cross-agency services feel
         consistent and maintainable.

    4. **High-quality, low-defect delivery**
       - Each accepted iteration meets a measurable Definition of Done including:
         - automated testing sufficient to maintain at least 90% test coverage for delivered code,
         - zero linting errors and warnings for front-end code style checks,
         - successful build and deployment to staging via a repeatable automated process,
         - documented dependencies and licenses, and system-level documentation suitable for handoff.

    5. **Security outcomes**
       - Delivered software is free of medium and high severity static/dynamic vulnerabilities as verified by
         agreed tools and approaches, with transparent handling of false positives.

    6. **Evidence-driven product decisions**
       - At a cadence agreed per work order, the State receives usable research artifacts and analytics on product
         usage (users/transactions/errors) to guide backlog prioritization and measure impact.

    7. **Platform decision support**
       - DoIT receives a comparative assessment of feasible CMS alternatives, focused on accessibility, usability,
         operational support, and alignment with statewide patterns, enabling informed decisions.

    ### 3. Constraints (Non-Negotiables and Boundaries)
    - **Work order delivery model**: Scope, specific technologies (if known), and any SLAs may be defined at the
      Work Order level; the base contract supports iterative delivery in 2–5 week increments.
    - **Data residency**: No processing or storage of State data outside the continental U.S.
    - **Cost boundaries**: Hardware and software costs must not exceed 30% of the total contract value; material
      costs are pass-through with no markup.
    - **Policy compliance**: Contractor must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and State policies/standards
      including Digital Services Playbook, Maryland SDLC, IT Security Policy, and Digital Accessibility Policy.
    - **Ownership and reuse**: Source code and core artifacts must remain in a State-controlled, version-controlled
      repository in the government domain.
    - **Open source**: Open-source solutions may be proposed, but operational support is required.
    - **Transition**: At the end of each work order, the State must be able to transition knowledge, documentation,
      and operating procedures to State staff or a follow-on vendor with minimal disruption.

    # Vendor Response Instructions (SOO-Based)

    ## What you are responding to
    This solicitation is outcome-based. DoIT is not buying a fixed task list.
    DoIT is buying measurable improvements in task completion, accessibility, quality, security,
    consistency, and operational reliability delivered iteratively via work orders.

    ## What your proposal must include
    1. **Outcome delivery approach**
       - How you will achieve the SOO objectives using short iterations (2–5 weeks) and a measurable Definition of Done.
       - How you will validate outcomes with users (research, usability testing) and show evidence of impact.

    2. **How you measure success**
       - Your proposed metrics for task success, usability, accessibility conformance, reliability, and delivery performance.
       - How analytics, monitoring, and error tracking will be instrumented and used for decision-making.

    3. **Quality, accessibility, and security controls**
       - How you will meet or exceed baseline acceptance thresholds (e.g., 90% test coverage, zero linting issues,
         signage of vulnerabilities, WCAG 2.1 AA conformance evidence).
       - Your approach to accessibility audits, remediation timelines, validation testing, and reporting.

    4. **Team and operating model**
       - Proposed roles, responsibilities, and collaboration model with DoIT Product Owner/State staff.
       - How you will support transition-out and knowledge transfer at the end of each work order.

    5. **Constraints acknowledgement**
       - Explicit confirmation of compliance with:
         - data residency (continental U.S. only),
         - cost boundaries (30% cap on hardware/software; no material markup),
         - applicable State policies and standards.

    ## What DoIT will evaluate
    - Credibility of your plan to achieve outcomes (not word count)
    - Evidence that your approach produces accessible, secure, low-defect software
    - Ability to adapt across work orders without lock-in
    - Strength of measurement, transparency, and knowledge transfer
