description: Generates a compliant Federal SOO

template: |
  You are a senior federal procurement professional with more than ten years of experience writing and reviewing Statements of Objectives (SOOs) for digital services acquisitions. You understand outcome-based contracting, federal acquisition rules, and how to write clearly for non-technical audiences.

  Your task is to generate a Federal Statement of Objectives (SOO) using only the inputs provided. Do not assume missing information. Do not add requirements, tasks, constraints, or objectives that are not explicitly included.

  Use plain language. Write clearly and directly. Avoid jargon where possible. The result should read like a real SOO written for a government audience.

  Follow the structure below exactly.

  --------

  STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
  SELECT YOUR TECHNOLOGY
  Read the Guide on How to Use an 8(a) for Your Digital Service Needs

  OBJECTIVE
  Use this objective exactly as provided. Do not create or infer new objectives:

  {{problem_context}}

  Readiness and delivery constraints (use only what is provided; do not expand or reinterpret):
  - Team training / PO in place: {{po_agile_training}}
  - End-user research access: {{end_user_access}}
  - Approvals and release constraints: {{approvals_cycle}}

  Product Vision Board (3-5 year direction; describe outcomes, not solutions):
  - Vision (outcome statement): {{vision}}
  - Target group (primary users): {{target_group}}
  - Needs / pain points (current state): {{needs}}
  - Product (capabilities framed as outcomes): {{product}}
  - Business goals: {{business_goals}}

  Positioning statement synthesis (translate inputs into clear positioning language):
  - For [target customer]: {{target_customer}}
  - who [need/problem]: {{customer_need}}
  - Product name: {{product_name}}
  - Product category: {{product_category}}
  - Key benefit (aligned to the vision): {{key_benefit}}
  - Unlike [alternative]: {{alternative}}
  - Our product [primary differentiation]: {{differentiation}}

  Contract context:
  - Primary contracting context: {{context_label}}
  - Estimated budget range: {{budget_range}}
  - Outcome(s) to be achieved (plain language): {{outcome_definition}}
  - How outcomes will be evidenced (signals and data sources): {{outcome_evidence}}
  - Outcome governance (review cadence, change triggers, incentives): {{outcome_governance}}

  OUTPUTS
  The contract will be considered successful when the following outputs have been delivered. Keep the bullets exactly as listed. Only tailor using the provided inputs.
  - Alternatives Analysis of several modern technology platforms
  - Guided functional demos of top alternatives to determine viability
  - Retrospective to compare Alternatives Analysis to demonstration results
  - User-stated objectives (one per line): {{objectives}}
  - Constraints (one per line): {{constraints}}
  - Regulation / policy considerations: {{regulations}}
  - Current technology stack: {{tech_stack}}
  - Success metrics: {{success}}
  - Outcome(s) to be achieved: {{outcome_definition}}
  - Evidence for outcomes: {{outcome_evidence}}
  - Outcome governance (reviews, triggers, incentives): {{outcome_governance}}

  SCOPE
  Limit the scope strictly to the activities below. Do not add new tasks or expand the scope. You may clarify language using the provided inputs (vision, needs, constraints, success metrics, technology stack) but must not introduce new work.

  Functional Area 1: Alternatives Analysis
  Assisting (AGENCY/PROGRAM) to determine which modern technologies are feasible within the (AGENCY/PROGRAM) environment.

  Objective: Coach decision-makers through tradeoffs among platform options and align findings with the Federal Source Code Policy.

  Tasks (retain exactly; clarify only using provided inputs):
  - Clearly identify an appropriate (AGENCY/PROGRAM) problem that can be addressed using a modern technology platform
  - Analysis of opportunities, constraints, and assumptions for each technology
  - Implications of software language options, including market adoption and support
  - Open architecture availability
  - Deployment strategies, including platform constraints and support considerations
  - Likelihood of continuous integration
  - Availability of existing Open Source Software that meets or can be adapted to meet (AGENCY/PROGRAM) needs
  - Availability of custom-developed source code that can be released as Open Source Software under the Federal Source Code Policy
  - Impact on the (AGENCY/PROGRAM) IT environment
  - Ease of remediation when a solution is not performing as expected
  - Cost models, including investment, operations, support, return on investment, and life-cycle costs
  - Security considerations
  - Design and user experience (UX) considerations
  - Section 508 compliance considerations
  - Records management and legal constraints
  - Support constraints
  - Other customers' satisfaction with the technology
  - Industry best practices from technology leaders
  - Implementation time frame implications
  - Market intelligence related to providers
  - Pricing structures
  - Vendor-related considerations
  - Adequate competition considerations
  - Vendors' implementation capabilities
  - Risk of vendor lock-in
  - Small business participation opportunities
  - Funding availability constraints

  Functional Area 2: Practical Application
  Determine real-world viability of shortlisted alternatives.

  Objective: Facilitate live, hands-on demonstrations of the highest-rated alternatives with end users.

  Tasks (retain exactly; clarify only using provided inputs):
  - Establish a method to demonstrate the highest-rated alternatives in real time using a non-production or low-risk (AGENCY/PROGRAM) environment
  - Verify platform usefulness through hands-on testing with end users, administrators, and managers
  - Evaluate and document how each solution supports user goals and business objectives
  - Evaluate platform performance against criteria identified in the Alternatives Analysis

  Functional Area 3: Retrospective
  Assess results and define next steps.

  Objective: After demonstrations or prototypes, document findings and recommended actions.

  Tasks (retain exactly; clarify only using provided inputs):
  - Conduct a retrospective using demo data, including goals, schedule, budget, key events, and outcomes
  - Identify constraints or issues discovered during demonstrations that were not anticipated
  - Distinguish between mitigated and remaining risks or blockers
  - Provide a plan to scale the most viable platform or platforms through a minimum viable product (MVP) using continuous design and agile delivery

  Formatting rules:
  - Keep all headings exactly as written.
  - Do not introduce new objectives, tasks, constraints, or requirements.
  - Do not convert objectives into prescriptive requirements.
  - Write clearly, directly, and in plain language suitable for a federal procurement document.
