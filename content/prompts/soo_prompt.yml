  Generate a Federal Statement of Objectives (SOO) using ONLY the provided inputs. Follow this exact structure and keep task/requirement language out of the SOO unless already provided.

  STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES
  SELECT YOUR TECHNOLOGY
  Read the Guide on How to Use an 8(a) for Your Digital Service Needs

  OBJECTIVE
  Use this objective; do not invent new ones: {{problem_context}}

  Readiness and delivery constraints (do not expand beyond inputs):
  - Team training / PO in place: {{po_agile_training}}
  - End-user research access: {{end_user_access}}
  - Approvals and release constraints: {{approvals_cycle}}

  Product Vision Board (3–5 year true north):
  - Vision (outcome statement): {{vision}}
  - Target group (primary users): {{target_group}}
  - Needs / pain points (current state): {{needs}}
  - Product (capabilities framed as outcomes): {{product}}
  - Business goals: {{business_goals}}

  Positioning statement synthesis:
  - For [target customer]: {{target_customer}}
  - who [need/problem]: {{customer_need}}
  - Product name: {{product_name}}
  - Product category: {{product_category}}
  - Key benefit (mapped from vision): {{key_benefit}}
  - Unlike [alternative]: {{alternative}}
  - Our product [primary differentiation]: {{differentiation}}

  Contract context:
  - Primary contracting context: {{context_label}}
  - Estimated budget range: {{budget_range}}

  OUTPUTS
  The resulting contract will be considered successful when the following outputs have been delivered. Keep the bullets; only tailor with provided inputs:
  - Alternatives Analysis of several modern technology platforms
  - Guided functional demos of top alternatives to determine viability
  - Retrospective to compare Alternatives Analysis to demonstration results
  - User-stated objectives (one per line): {{objectives}}
  - Constraints (one per line): {{constraints}}
  - Regulation / policy considerations: {{regulations}}
  - Current technology stack: {{tech_stack}}
  - Success metrics: {{success}}

  BACKGROUND
  If the user provided background, summarize it from the inputs above; otherwise leave a brief placeholder.

  SCOPE
  Limit the scope to the activities below. Keep headings and bullet lists; do not add new tasks beyond what is stated. You may weave in user inputs for clarity (vision, needs, constraints, success metrics, tech stack).

  Functional Area 1: Alternatives Analysis: Assisting (AGENCY/PROGRAM) to determine which modern technologies are feasible to implement in (AGENCY/PROGRAM) environment.
  Objective: Coach through tradeoffs for alternative platform solutions; align with Federal Source Code Policy.
  Tasks (retain; clarify only with provided inputs):
  - Clearly identify an appropriate (AGENCY/PROGRAM) problem that can be solved with a modern technology platform.
  - Analysis of opportunities, constraints, and assumptions for each technology
  - Implications of software language options (commonality and adoption in the market place)
  - Open architecture availability
  - Deployment strategies (Analyze platform constraints and support)
  - Likelihood of continuous integration
  - Availability of pre-existing Open Source Software that meets or can be modified to meet (AGENCY/PROGRAM) needs
  - Availability of custom-developed source code to be Open Source Software and available to the public, as referenced in the Federal Source Code Policy
  - Impact on (AGENCY/PROGRAM) IT environment
  - Ease to fix when technology solution is not performing
  - Cost models: investment, operating, support, ROI, life-cycle
  - Security considerations
  - Design and user experience (UX) considerations
  - 508 compliance considerations
  - Records and legal constraints
  - Support constraints
  - Other customers’ satisfaction with the technology
  - Industry best practice suggestions from technology leaders
  - Implementation time frame implications
  - Market Intelligence Around Providers
  - Pricing structures
  - Vendor based considerations
  - Adequate competition considerations
  - Vendors’ implementation capabilities
  - Risk of potential vendor lock-in
  - Small business vendor opportunities
  - Constraints of funding availability

  Functional Area 2: Practical Application: Determine viability
  Objective: Facilitate live hands-on demonstrations of the highest rated alternatives with end users in (AGENCY/PROGRAM) or vendor-provided environments.
  Tasks (retain; clarify only with provided inputs):
  - Obtain or establish a method to demonstrate in real time the highest rated results from the Alternatives Analysis, in order to use those technologies on a non-production or low risk version of the (AGENCY/PROGRAM) environment
  - Verify the utility of the platform by testing with end users (users, admins, managers)
  - Evaluate and document how the solutions met end user goals and strategic business objectives
  - Evaluate performance of platform/solution against criteria identified in the Alternatives Analysis

  Functional Area 3: Retrospective: What worked, what didn’t, what to do next
  Objective: After prototypes/demos, develop conclusions and next steps.
  Tasks (retain; clarify only with provided inputs):
  - Conduct a retrospective on demo data (goals, timeline, budget, events, success/failures)
  - Evaluate factors/constraints found during demos that were not anticipated
  - Determine mitigated vs. remaining roadblocks
  - Provide a plan for scaling the most viable platform(s)/solution(s) via MVP using continuous design and agile processes

  Formatting rules:
  - Keep headings exactly as above.
  - Do not invent new objectives, constraints, or tasks beyond the lists; only clarify with provided inputs.
  - Keep outcomes/constraints; avoid prescriptive requirements language beyond what is listed.
